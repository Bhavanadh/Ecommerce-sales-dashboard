# Ecommerce-sales-dashboard and trend analysis
Power BI and Python project for analyzing e-commerce sales, detecting trends, and visualizing insights to boost business growth.
This project showcases an end-to-end E-commerce Sales Dashboard and Trend Analysis.  

It integrates:
Power BI: Interactive dashboard for sales KPIs, customer segmentation, and product performance.  
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib): One-series trend analysis for sales forecasting and inventory optimization.  
Excel: Data preprocessing and reporting.  

# Key Outcomes
Built a Power BI dashboard for decision-makers.  
Identified growth opportunities leading to a 15% sales boost.  
Delivered clear business reports with visual storytelling.  
 
# Tools & Libraries
  Python 3 (Google Colab / Jupyter environment)
 /pandas
  /matplotlib
 /seaborn
 /Power BI
 /Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
 /Excel  

# Key Features
 Cleans and preprocesses the e-commerce sales dataset  
 Converts order dates to datetime format  
 Aggregates and groups sales data by month  
 Visualizes:
 -Monthly sales trends  
 -Top products by revenue  
 -Customer segmentation insights  
 -Power BI dashboard for KPIs, growth metrics, and product performance
# Dataset Used
We use a simplified e-commerce sales dataset.
Example columns include:  
'Order Date'  
'Sales'  
'Category'  
'Sub-Category'  
'Customer Segment'  
'Region  
'Profit'  
This dataset is uploaded manually to Colab or imported into Power BI during runtime.  
 
# How to Run This Project
1. Python / Jupyter Notebook  
    Open the notebook (`notebooks/trend_analysis.ipynb`) in Jupyter or Colab  
    Upload the `sales_data.csv` file manually (via sidebar in Colab or local path in Jupyter)  
    Run all cells to see analysis and charts  

2. Power BI Dashboard  
   Open `reports/Sales_Dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop  
   Refresh data connections  
   Interact with visualizations

# Sample Visualizations
 -Monthly Sales Trend (line chart)  
 -Top 5 Products by Revenue (bar chart)  
 -Customer Segmentation (Power BI visual)  
These visualizations help identify sales patterns, growth areas, and customer behavior.

# Future Improvements
 -Add profit trend analysis 
 -Region-wise and segment-wise breakdown  
 -Build an interactive dashboard (e.g., Plotly, Dash, or Streamlit)  
 -Automate data refresh for Power BI
